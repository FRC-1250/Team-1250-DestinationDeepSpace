Team 1250 Official 2019 Code for Destination: Deep Space

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project on your local machine that is able to be deployed to the cRIO. 

### Prerequisites

You'll need the following in order use this code:
1) VSCode source code editor with WPILib intregration - https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/1027503-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc
2) GitHub desktop (this will cover using github desktop but an equivalent git option can be used) - https://desktop.github.com/\
3) We assume that cRIO has already been configured.

### Steps
4) Connect the machine in use to the robot via the USB type A to USB type B connector
5) Follow the steps from github on how to clone this repo to your computer - https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop
6) Once the project has been downloaed, open VSCode
7) Select file > open folder and navigate to the cloned project to open it
8) Once the project has opened, use the short CTRL+SHIFT+P to open the quick menu for VSCode and select "WPILib: Deploy robot code"
9) The code should now start deploying to the connected cRIO

## FAQ
*What is Git?* - It's a version control system that allows for easy group collaboration. Most often it's used for software development but it's not only limited to that. It could be easily used to persist changes in other types of files as well. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control

*How do I contribute?* - In our private Discord or Facebook group, contact Damien Fullerton, Ruiqi Mao OR Rodney Lewis with your account name or email. We'll get you added to the project from there.

*What if I don't wan't to program?* - You don't have to. However, with an account you can still use the feature/bug tracking features built into GitHub to help us keep track of items that need to be improved/fixed. You could also set up notifications to get updates on the code that is being used to manipulate the parts you've built. Otherwise, you can just use it as a read only source to see changes being made in the code for the 2019 Deep Space robot if you're interested.
