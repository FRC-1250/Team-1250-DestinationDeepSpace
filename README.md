## FAQ
*What is Git*? - It's a version control system that allows for easy group collaboration. Most often it's used for software development but it's not only limited to that. It could be easily used to persist changes in other types of files as well. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control

*How do I contribute* - See Contributing above.

*What if I don't wan't to program?* - You don't have to. However, with an account you can still use the feature/bug tracking features built into GitHub to help us keep track of items that need to be improved/fixed. You could also set up notifications to get updates on the code that is being used to manipulate the parts you've built. Otherwise, you can just use it as a read only source to see changes being made in the code for the 2019 Deep Space robot if you're interested.
